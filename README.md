### Metagenomic worshop

The workshop explores multiple topics:

* Genome assembly, quality control and annotation
* Genomic and ribosomal taxonomic identification
* Bacteria Community de-replication and pangenome
* Metagenomics host reads removal and bacteria quantification

It also touch upon:

* NCBI data retrieval
* Slurm interactive session
* conda environment and package managing

Each workshop wwas design to be independent and computationally light. However, these are somehow interlinked and sequential (that's why the numbers). Moreover, the workshops are planned to run in a cluster-type resource, therefore we can't promise that all the computation is possible in a laptop/pc not meant for high performace.

This workshop is inspired by the work performed in:
